## 🛒 Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS

This project is a static clone of the Amazon India homepage, built using only **HTML and CSS**. The goal was to replicate the core layout, styling, and user experience of the original site — without using any JavaScript.

### 💡 Features

- **Header Section**: Contains a top navigation bar with the Amazon logo, a search bar, location info, cart icon, etc. — mimicking the real Amazon nav bar.
- **Main Content**: Displays product cards in a grid layout with images, product names, and "See More" links.
- **Footer Section**: Includes standard links like *About Us*, *Contact Us*, *Privacy Policy*, and *Terms of Service*.
- **Styling**: Colors and styling inspired by the original Amazon website — using Amazon’s signature orange, black, and white tones.

### 📁 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code** or any code editor.
3. All images are provided — stored in an `images/` folder.
4. Make sure `index.html` and `style.css` are placed correctly in the root directory.

This is only the **homepage clone** for now. More features and interactivity may be added in the future using JavaScript.
